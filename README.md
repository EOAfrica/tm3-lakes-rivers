# Monitoring Lakes and Rivers with Altimetry

Part of EO for Africa Research and Development unit *Training Module 3: Water and Energy Budget*

**Author: Roelof Rietbroek**

*LICENSE: TBD*

## Introduction and learning outcomes
This component of the training module, will introduce the use of radar altimetry for the retrieval of water heights over rivers and lakes. It will furthermore, explain the concept of deriving river discharge from river heights.

This component has the following **learning outcomes**:
1. Understand the measurement principle of radar altimetry
2. Understand how river heights and river discharge are linked to each other
3. Apply and execute a jupyter notebook demo which demonstrates the use of Sentinel-6 data for river and lakes applications 

## Content:

* A: The role of radar-altimetry for the water cycle (articles, movies, show cases), (1 hour)
* B: River heights versus discharge, (1 hour)
* C: Case study: River heights (and discharge?) from Sentinel-6 (2 hours)
